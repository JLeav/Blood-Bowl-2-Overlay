# Blood-Bowl-2-Overlay
Create an overlay that shows a partial state of the game. Including players on the field/KO/Cas boxes. This is mainly to be used for streaming to have a nice reference for viewers as to the current state of the game.

Currently, this will launch two GUIs; one that can edit the information, and one that can display it. The eventual plan is to have the display happening on a local website rather than a GUI with the intent of the broadcasting software being able to aquire the image needed without an extra browser window opened.
